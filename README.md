Requirements
------------

Installation instructions:
-------------------------


### Using Composer

[As both Symfony 2 and OroCRM use [Composer][2] to manage their dependencies, this is the recommended way to install OroCRM.]

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

- Clone http://github.com/orocrm/crm-application.git OroCRM project with

    git clone http://github.com/orocrm/crm-application.git

- Go to app/config folder and create parameters.yml using parameters.yml.dist as example. Update database name and credentials.
  Alternatively parameters.yml can be created automatically on the next step when run composer install command,
  you will be able to customize all the values interactively.
- Install OroCRM dependencies with composer. If installation process seems too slow you can use "--prefer-dist" option.

    php composer.phar install

- Initialize application with install script (for Linux and Mac OS install.sh, for Windows install.bat)

After installation you can login as application administrator using user name "admin" and password "admin".

Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting to code, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for a Symfony application.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://your_domain/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.
